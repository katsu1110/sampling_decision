# sampling_decision

A model of perceptual decision-making (2-AFC) with neural sampling

S_Experiment runs the main program. It takes one parameter, a struct that is generated by running S_Exp_Para. S_Exp_Para takes one argument, a string that must match a case present in the file. Feel free to add cases as needed. Once this struct is gneerated, it can be passed to S_Experiment. Sampling_Gibbs_InPlace_fast_e performs gibbs sampling on a generated image to infer a decision about the orientation of a gabor filter present in the image, and is called directly from S_Experiment.

run 'S_Exp_para.m','S_Experiment.m','Kernel_Compute.m','trcut.m'
as 'out = S_Experiment(S_Exp_Para('PK-amplitude10'))'
& 'Kernel_Compute(trcut(out,39),'nbin',4,'resample',1000)'

This procedure ensures that the signal strength is 10, choice and confidence are assigned at the timing of frame 39 (out of 100), 4 data points, and 1000 bootstrap resampling for error-bars.
It takes some hours dependent on a computer you use. To reduce the time, get into the original script of 'S_Exp_para.m' and modify the number of repeat. Also you can emit 'resample' option from 'Kernel_Compute.m' not to do the resampling.
